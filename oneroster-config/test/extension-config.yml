# This is a sample configuration file for a user extension.
#
# This file extends the behavior specified in your main configuration file,
# by adding custom python code to the logic for attribute and group mapping
# which is specified in the directory_users section.
#
# To load your extension file, put the file's relative or absolute path
# as the value of the extension setting in the directory_users section
# of your main configuration file.

# (optional) extended_attributes (default value is an empty list)
# extended_attributes is a list of attribute names whose per-user
# values are required by your extension in order to function properly.
# These attributes will be read on a per-user basis, and will be available
# in the source_attributes dictionary in your after_mapping_hook.  Any
# of these attributes which don't have a value in the directory entry for
# a given user will have a Python None value in that user's dictionary.
